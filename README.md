## üìã Available Schemas

### üîπ SoEasily Workflow Schema (v1.0)
**File:** [`schemas/v1/soeasily-workflow.json`](./schemas/v1/soeasily-workflow.json)

The workflow schema defines the structure for creating complete SoEasily workflows. A workflow consists of:

- **Header** - Metadata including ID, title, description, version, and tags
- **Actions** - Array of action instances with unique instance IDs and configurations
- **Connections** - Defines execution flow between actions with data mapping and conditional logic
- **Error Handling** - Global error handling strategy with retry policies

**Key Features:**
- JMESPath/JSONata expressions for data transformation
- Conditional branching logic
- Global error handling and retry mechanisms
- Version control and tagging system

### üîπ SoEasily Action Schema (v1.0)
**File:** [`schemas/v1/soeasily-action.json`](./schemas/v1/soeasily-action.json)

The action schema defines individual action definitions that can be used within workflows. Each action includes:

- **Identification** - Globally unique ID with namespace (e.g., `http_request`)
- **Author Information** - Details about the action creator and support resources
- **Documentation** - User-friendly titles, descriptions, categories, and localization
- **Schemas** - JSON Schema definitions for configuration, input, output, and credentials
- **Testing** - Built-in test cases for validation

**Categories:**
- `trigger` - Workflow initiators
- `control_flow` - Conditional and branching logic
- `data_operation` - Data transformation and manipulation
- `execution_scripting` - Code execution and scripting
- `integration_generic` - Third-party service integrations
- `ai_llm` - AI and language model operations
- `utility` - Helper and utility functions
